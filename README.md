 **➡️ The direction I want to go**

>Watching CEO Lee Doo-hee of "Like a Cool Lion" solve the mask crisis through the mask notification web, I aimed to become a "web developer who contributes to society by identifying consumers' inconveniences and providing convenience." I want to be a web developer who can learn more and listen to various opinions.
